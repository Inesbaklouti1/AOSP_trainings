# AOSP Training Labs

Welcome to the AOSP training labs! This README provides an overview of the various labs available for learning and practicing with the Android Open Source Project (AOSP).

## Labs
### AOSP_Lab00_build_AOSP

This lab likely covers the basics of building the entire Android Open Source Project (AOSP) from source code. It might involve setting up the build environment, downloading the source code, configuring build options, and executing the build process.

### AOSP_Lab01_cc_binary

This lab focuses on building and running a `cc_binary` target in the AOSP source code. It covers creating a new C++ file, configuring the Android.bp file, adding packages to aosp_cf.mk, exporting the path, building the project, launching the Cuttlefish virtual device, and running the binary.

### AOSP_Lab02_cc_shared_library

In this lab, you will work with a `cc_shared_library` target in the AOSP source code. It includes steps for creating a new C++ file, configuring the Android.bp file, adding packages to aosp_cf.mk, exporting the path, building the project, launching the Cuttlefish virtual device, and running the library.

### AOSP_Lab03_cc_prebuilt_shared_library

This lab likely involves working with prebuilt shared libraries (cc_prebuilt_shared_library) within the AOSP source code. Participants may learn how to incorporate prebuilt libraries into their AOSP projects and configure them appropriately.

### AOSP_Lab04_cc_genrule

This lab may focus on using cc_genrule within the AOSP source code. cc_genrule allows for generating files during the build process. Participants may learn how to define custom rules for generating source files, headers, or other build artifacts.

### AOSP_Lab05_cc_binary_host

In this lab, participants may learn about building host-based binaries (cc_binary_host) within the AOSP source code. This involves creating binaries that run on the development machine rather than on the target device.

### AOSP_Lab05_cc_binary_host_2 (other method)

This lab could be an alternative method or an extension of Lab05 for building host-based binaries within the AOSP source code. It may cover additional techniques or use cases.

### AOSP_Lab06_cvd_binary

This lab likely involves building a binary specifically for the Cuttlefish virtual device (cvd_binary). Participants may learn about developing and testing software specifically for virtualized Android environments
